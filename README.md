# smm-maternalmorbidity-r-python
This project is a critical first step towards solving the maternal mortality crisis in the United States. It is significant because it provides a plan of action that merges data, analytics, machine learning technology, technology and strategic deployment of targeted clinical care to avert bad maternal health outcomes.  This plan of action, while focus initially on the Georgia Medicaid population, can be scaled to public and private payors alike, thereby giving us concrete and repeatable steps to finally solve the maternal mortality crisis in the United States.
Methods:
Previously funded work has allowed us to construct a dataset of all Medicaid-covered deliveries in Georgia from 2020-2024 including individual-level eligibility and demographic characteristics; inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy claims and indicators for both SMM and chronic conditions using data from Georgia Medicaid claims and encounters. 
Our methodological approach to this project has three main parts. Taken together, these steps will allow us to avert bad outcomes through strategic deployment of information on high-risk pregnant members to avert bad outcomes. 
•	Aim 1: Develop a predictive model to identify high-risk pregnant Georgia Medicaid members by training, comparing and combining various supervised machine learning algorithms into ensembles to classify Severe Maternal Morbidity (SMM) using public health datasets.

•	Aim 2: We will use the algorithm to generate real-time risk scores for Georgia Medicaid members who are currently pregnant.
